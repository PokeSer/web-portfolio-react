# web-portfolio-react
My first application in react, this is just a test, although if you like it you can use it.

## Installation
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary modules
- After installing the modules, you can use `npm start` to start the app in development mode, or you can use `npm run build` to compile the production version.

**This project has been carried out with the purpose of learning react and improving my knowledge in JavaScript. If you want to contribute, you can open a pull request, but tell me what you want to implement or improve.**
